SublimeLinter-contrib-htmlhint 1.1.2
------------------------------------
This plugin has been updated to handle htmlhint's new stdin input feature. This means errors will be reported as you type them, rather than when you save.

*** NOTE: htmlhint version 0.9.13 and greater is now required. ***

Upgrade your existing htmlhint to the latest by running:
npm install -g htmlhint@latest
